# *YINGWEN*

YINGWEN app was build in order to ease the struggles that Chinese students experience daily. Since Chinese children are not allowed to study English besides school facilities nowadays, they have to attain tons of information for a short period by themselves. This app will help them to learn English and get the highest grades in their final exams. YINGWEN app is mainly aimed at enhancing English skills and passing the final English exams at primary and middle schools.
